### ⚙️ Installation & Setup
## 1️⃣ Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-damage-assessment.git
cd ai-damage-assessment

## 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

## 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ▶️ Run the Application
streamlit run app.py


## Application runs at:

http://localhost:8501

## 🧠 How It Works

User uploads an image

Image preprocessing (resize, intensity analysis)

Feature extraction

Damage classification logic

Result displayed with severity level

## 📈 Future Enhancements

🔬 Integrate CNN-based deep learning model

📊 Add confidence score visualization

☁ Deploy on AWS / Streamlit Cloud

📡 Integrate real-time UAV camera feed

📁 Add dataset training pipeline

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

Demonstrates applied AI in defense & aerospace context
